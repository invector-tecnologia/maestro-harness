# ⚡ MAESTRO HARNESS FOR AI

**You are the orchestrator. This harness executes your vision.**

Maestro is a **relentless AI command deck**: a headless **Rust core** for blazing speed and rock-solid safety, paired with a separate **Nim/Niobium TUI** for a flicker-free interactive command deck. Instead of coordinating human developers, you coordinate, test, and manage a **team of AI agents** to architect and build software on your command.

Fire up the TUI. Define your personas, scopes, and skills. Watch your AI team synthesize, execute, and iterate. No memorized commands. No friction. Just pure orchestration.

> 🚧 **PRE-RELEASE / ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT**
>
> Maestro **0.1.0** is a **Minimum Lovable Product (MLP)**. Core runtime features are functional and tested, but many capabilities remain in development. This is **not production-ready software**. See [Feature Status](#-feature-status) below for detailed maturity levels. Expect breaking changes and incomplete workflows.

## 🌟 Core Capabilities

Maestro's brain is **Rust-native**. Fast. Uncompromising. Its interactive **TUI** (Terminal User Interface) is a separate Nim process that consumes [Niobium](https://github.com/invector-tecnologia/niobium) — an immediate-mode, ratatui-inspired Nim TUI library — delivering menus, tables, real-time logs, and keyboard shortcuts over a line-delimited JSON protocol, all without terminal bloat or command memorization. The core stays fully usable headless with `--no-tui`.

### ⚡ What You Control
* **✅ Multi-Provider AI Synthesis (Operational):** Run models locally and free with **Ollama** (no API key), or connect **OpenAI**, **Anthropic**, and **Google Gemini** with API credentials. All four adapters are registered in the provider registry. **Per-agent model routing** lets each persona run a different model — see [Control Deck Initialization](#-control-deck-initialization). Cloud providers require valid API keys; reliability hardening continues through v0.2+.
* **🚧 Governance Codex (In Progress):** Define *Personas* (AI profiles), *Scopes* (execution domains), *Skills* (tool capabilities). Core persona/scope creation works; skill system and compliance enforcement in development.
* **📋 Secure Credentials (Planned):** OAuth2 browser login to Google Gemini planned. Basic local config auth operational; keychain integration roadmap v0.2+.
* **✅ Agent Observability (Operational):** Tracing of agent decisions and token usage implemented. Cost tracking and full audit logs planned for v0.2+.

### ⚡ Dependency Matrix
Maestro partitions the dependency graph into **two isolation zones**:

**Zone 1: Harness Domain** — Maestro runtime readiness. LLM provider config, model catalog, connection health.

**Zone 2: Project Domain** — Your repo's AI companion. Toolchain checks, command availability, framework validation (defined in `maestro/project-deps.yml`).

Validate each zone independently:

```bash
maestro deps check --scope harness      # Check Maestro runtime only
maestro deps check --scope project      # Check project toolchain only
maestro deps check --scope all          # Full validation
```

## ⚡ BOOT SEQUENCE

**⚠️ FOR DEVELOPMENT & TESTING ONLY** — This is pre-release software. Suitable for local testing and development workflows. Do not deploy to production environments.

**Open your terminal.** On macOS and Linux: search for "Terminal". On Windows: open "PowerShell" or "Command Prompt".

### 🪄 AUTO-DEPLOY (macOS & Linux)
Run this one-liner to synthesize and install:

**Copy and paste this command, then press `Enter`:**
```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/invector-tecnologia/maestro-ai-harness/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```
*Note: You may need to enter your system password to install. Characters won't show as you type—this is normal. Just type and press Enter. The installer downloads a pre-compiled release binary when one is available for your platform, and automatically falls back to building from source (requires the Rust toolchain) otherwise.*

---

### 🔧 MANUAL OVERRIDE (Build from Source)
If auto-deploy fails, or you prefer direct control, follow your OS track:

#### 🍎 MACOS
Generate the native `.pkg` installer from source:
1. Open the terminal in the project folder.
2. Generate the package: `./scripts/build-macos-pkg.sh 0.1.0`
3. Install by double-clicking the generated file or run in terminal:
```bash
sudo installer -pkg target/macos/build/maestro-ai-0.1.0-macos-$(uname -m).pkg -target /
```

#### 🐧 DEBIAN / UBUNTU / LINUX MINT
1. Navigate to project folder.
2. Build: `./scripts/build-deb.sh 0.1.0`
3. Deploy:
```bash
sudo dpkg -i target/deb/maestro-ai_0.1.0_amd64/maestro-ai.deb
```

#### 🎩 ARCH LINUX / OMARCHY
1. Navigate to project folder.
2. Build: `./scripts/build-omarchy-pkg.sh 0.1.0`
3. Deploy:
```bash
sudo pacman -U --noconfirm target/omarchy/build/maestro-ai-0.1.0-1-$(uname -m).pkg.tar.zst
```

> **⚡ Validation Override:** Run the smoke test to verify installation integrity:
> `./scripts/smoke-test-omarchy.sh target/omarchy/build/maestro-ai-0.1.0-1-$(uname -m).pkg.tar.zst`

## ⚡ CONTROL DECK INITIALIZATION

All governance, TUI state, and project configurations live inside the `maestro/` folder in your project root. Maestro reads `./maestro/config.yml` first; if not found, it scans the global system config path. A legacy `config.yaml` is still accepted with a deprecation warning.

**This is your control deck schema.** Define providers, models, concurrency limits, rate limits, retry logic. Example: orchestrating Ollama locally:

```yaml
system:
  default_provider: "ollama"
  default_model: "mistral"
  max_concurrency: 4
  rate_limit_per_minute: 120
  retry_max_attempts: 3

providers:
  ollama:
    kind: "ollama"
    endpoint: "http://127.0.0.1:11434/v1"
    auth_mode: "none"
    timeout_ms: 60000
    models:
      - name: "mistral"
        context_window: 32000
    capabilities:
      supports_tools: false
      supports_streaming: true
      supports_json_mode: false
      supports_reasoning_controls: false
      max_context_tokens: 32000
```

**Auth Override:** For Bearer token authentication, adjust `auth_mode` to `"bearer"` and export the token as an environment variable before launching Maestro.

**Per-Agent Models:** Every model declared under a provider is available to any agent. Assign a specific provider + model to individual personas with the optional top-level `agents:` map. Agents that are not listed fall back to `system.default_provider` + `system.default_model`. The pair must exist in `providers:` or Maestro fails fast on startup.

```yaml
agents:
  "Maestro":
    provider: "openai"
    model: "gpt-4-turbo"
  "Software Engineer":
    provider: "anthropic"
    model: "claude-3-opus"
  "Quality Assurance":
    provider: "ollama"
    model: "mistral"
```

> The keys above are persona names (the default catalog ships `Maestro`, `Project Manager`, `Quality Assurance`, `User Experience`, `Software Engineer`). Every provider and model referenced under `agents:` must also be declared under `providers:`. See [`maestro/config.yml.example`](maestro/config.yml.example) for a complete multi-provider catalog.

## ⚡ COMMAND EXECUTION

**Execution Protocol.** Boot your orchestration workflow:

1. **INIT** — `maestro init <project-name>` synthesizes project folder, default config, and mandatory directories. Opens interactive onboarding by default.
2. **SCRIPTED INIT** — `maestro init <project-name> --no-tui` for CI/CD and automation (no interactive prompts).
3. **VALIDATE** — `maestro validate-config` checks configuration integrity and dependency health.
4. **LAUNCH** — `maestro tui` fires up your interactive command deck.
5. **ARCHITECT** — Inside TUI, execute `/new scope`, `/new persona`, `/new skill` to map execution domains and AI profiles, or `/architect` to open Architect Mode, the directive governance home (Create/Edit/Update/Delete). Return to the monitor with `/monitor`.
6. **EXECUTE** — `maestro run` triggers automated work cycles. In Workspace Mode the Maestro agent orchestrates the demand end to end — plan, delegate to each persona, audit every contribution, then deliver a synthesized result — with live narration and a heartbeat while long-running agents work. Monitor logs. Watch your AI team synthesize.

### ⚡ Utility Commands

* **`maestro doctor`** — Health scan. Validates environment, mandatory markdowns, and config readiness.
* **`maestro init-config`** — Generates only `maestro/config.yml`.
* **`maestro scaffold-markdown`** — Generates only Markdown folder structure.
* **`maestro deps check --scope <harness|project|all>`** — Validates dependency zones independently.
* **`maestro list-agents`** — Catalogs all registered personas.

## ⚡ GOVERNANCE OVERRIDE

Every release passes through a **Quality Gate**. Validate locally:

```bash
./scripts/quality-gate.sh              # Run full quality validation
./scripts/publish-github.sh v0.1.0    # Build and publish release to GitHub
```

### ⚡ PR Governance Protocol

This repository enforces **CI-gated governance** through `.github/workflows/ai-governance-gate.yml`.

**Required PR Structure:**
1. `## Linked Plan Task` — exactly one line:
  - `- Path: docs/Maestro_Execution_Plans/tasks/<task>.md`
2. `## Acceptance Criteria` — IDs like `AC1`, `AC2`, `AC3`.
3. `## Validation Evidence` — one evidence line per AC ID.

**Acceptance Criteria Floor:** Configurable via repository variable `MIN_ACCEPTANCE_ITEMS`. Defaults to `3` if not set.

**Configure in GitHub:**
1. Repo Settings → `Secrets and variables` → `Actions` → `Variables`
2. Create `MIN_ACCEPTANCE_ITEMS` with numeric value (e.g., `4`)
