"""
Act as a Platform UX Engineer for guided project setup.
Goal: Implement Maestro's new-project onboarding in Tatui.

Before generating code, open a `<reasoning>` block and validate robustness in an environment without an active provider.

Execute:
1. Create stages: diagnosis, provider/model config, markdown scaffold, final validation.
2. Offer a fast mode (defaults) and a detailed mode (advanced fields).
3. Show a final summary with recommended next commands.
4. Ensure recovery from failures without closing the session.

[Cohesion Mechanism]:
- Confirm that a new project is operational at the end of the flow.

Return ONLY the modified code blocks in Markdown. No introduction.
