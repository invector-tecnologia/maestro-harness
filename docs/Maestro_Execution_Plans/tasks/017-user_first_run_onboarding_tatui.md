## 3. EXECUTION PROMPT (Paste into Copilot Chat)
"""
Act as a Product Engineer focused on developer-tool onboarding.
Goal: Implement Maestro's first-run user onboarding in Tatui.

Before generating code, open a `<reasoning>` block and validate the first-contact UX.

Execute:
1. Create a welcome screen/state for a new user.
2. Implement short feature introduction steps.
3. Allow the options: continue, skip, or view again later.
4. Persist onboarding state (not started / in progress / completed / skipped).

[Cohesion Mechanism]:
- Ensure that first-run reduces time-to-first-useful-action for the user.

Return ONLY the modified code blocks in Markdown. No introduction.
